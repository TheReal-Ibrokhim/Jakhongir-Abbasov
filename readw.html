                            <p>

                                <br> <br>
                                I am experienced an enthusiastic and focused teacher committed to safeguarding and promoting the education and well-being of learners at all times, managing not only students but also their parents and fellow teachers all with the aim of promoting and reinforcing a student's independence and self-esteem. I am passionate about giving learners the best possible education in and working in a busy environment and relish the challenge of a diverse workload.
